A small program for automating downloading an ephemeris file from the NASA website, generating a binary samples file for RTL-SDR, and running a simulation (currently only hackrf)

Currently Russian language only

The [files for generation](https://github.com/Nis12/gps_apate/tree/main/gpssim_generator) are used from the [gps-sdr-sim](https://github.com/osqzss/gps-sdr-sim)
